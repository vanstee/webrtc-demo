WebRTC Demo
===========

Only supports Chrome Cannary (27.0.1416.0) although 26.x.x.x might have basic
support for WebRTC.

This is totally not production ready, but it sorta works. There is no error
handling, channel support, or automated joining. Once two users have loaded the
app, allow the broswer to use your video camera and the call should start.
